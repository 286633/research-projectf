        <p class="paragraph" >In Illinois there are some great places to fish at. I will be covering some of the good places and some of the bad places. Your best luck is to go for bass and bluegill. There are other fish that are good too. If you are looking to catch a personal best or just catch a lot of fish, I would recommend fishing for bass. If you are looking for fish to eat I would recommend fishing for bluegill. There are other fish that are decently populated like catfish and trout.
            <br>
            <br>
            I will be telling you about the Skokie Lagoons, Beck Lake, Belleau Lake, and Glenview Lake. This website will tell you the best spots to fish at the the best fish to fish for. It will also tell you details about the lake and how to catch the best fish. You will learn all about these lakes around Illinois and you'll be catching tons of fish the text time you go.

  This is a okay place to go to. I would recommend going in the Fall or Spring for the trout. If you aren't going for trout then you should probally fish somewhere else. This lake is 12 acres with a maximum depth of 31.6 feet.

<h1>What you need to know</h1>
<p>
  Do not fish here. You could fish here for days and still not catch anything. There is nothing special about this lake. Go somewhere elese if you find yourself fishing here. If you do fish here the only okay spot is under the bridge. It is catch and release and there are no boats allowed. The lake is 45 acres and the maximum depth is 19 feet.
